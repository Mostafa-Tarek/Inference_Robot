# Inference Robot

The goal of this project is  to initiate my own inference project using `Nvidia DIGITS workspace` and to build `classifier` depending on `Transfer learning` like ( `LeNet`  ,`AlexNet` , `googleNet` ). 

### Project divide into two Tasks:

* **First part is an inference project against supplied `digit image` recognition dataset**

* **Second part is to build inference project from the `data collected` by mine. For more information see my `pdf`.**
